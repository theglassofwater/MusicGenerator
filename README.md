# MusicGenerator

Generate symbolic music using Transformer-based deep learning models. This project tokenizes musical elements like notes and timings and applies Transformer models to create original compositions. It includes utilities for model training, fine-tuning, and music generation.

## Features
- **Music Tokenization**: Converts musical notes and events into tokens.
- **Model Training**: Provides Jupyter notebooks for pretraining, fine-tuning, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Music Generation**: Generates sequences of music tokens which can be rendered into symbolic music.

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theglassofwater/MusicGenerator.git
cd MusicGenerator
```
Then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Organize your musical data into the `data/` directory.
2. **Model Training**: Run notebooks for pretraining or fine-tuning as needed.
3. **Generate Music**: Use generation scripts to create symbolic music.

For more details, check each notebook in the `notebooks/` folder.
